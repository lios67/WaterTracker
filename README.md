# WaterTracker

Final Version of the WaterTracker App

Uses: A mobile application that enables users to track their daily water intake and receive reminders to drink water throughout the day. This project required me to design the user interface, implement the backend, and ensure the data storage and retrieval functioned correctly.

IOS:14.0



Run the App! You can see the history of the water volume in descending order based on the dates. Displays both the water volume and date. Click on the Plus ICON to add a new entry to the history
